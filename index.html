            <div class="pl-20 pr-10 w-full text-center">
                A resume should speak for itself but this special occasion warrants a quick
                introduction. Electrical Engineering at UTwente is tough and fairly unpredictible in terms of
                time consumption. This makes it difficult to be a reliable member for student teams or other fun
                extracuricular pastimes. Since I still want to make cool tech I decided to realize a bunch of passion
                projects. From a massive home-automation system to an app to learn reading
                sheetmusic as fast as possible, every waking moment that I am not busy with university, friends or
                family
                I spent working on personal projects. I also turned my
                hobby of electronics and software development into a very flexible part-time job for when I do not have
                much inspiration for my own projects by starting my own business and providing custom technology to
                solve client's problems. <br> As you can see, sitting still is
                a
                skill I have yet to learn!
